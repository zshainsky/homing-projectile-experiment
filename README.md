## Description
Experimental code for testing different types of projectiles

## Example
In the video below the Projectile's vectors are drawn as follows:
* Green: Velocity
* Purple: Desired Veolocity (always pointing from the projectile to the target)
* Yellow: Acceleration (how fast Velocity changes to Desired Veolocity)
